Filmgrain is an iOS application for keeping track of what film you've left
inside of your assorted film cameras. This would have sold much better in the
80's.

This is my first iOS app, and the code is the sort of dumpster fire you'd
expect is anyone's first app. I'll be slowly cleaning it up as time permits in
Feb/Mar of 2016.
